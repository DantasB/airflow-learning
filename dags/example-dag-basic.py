# DAG Example
    This is an example DAG that uses the Airflow API to create a DAG.

## DAG Details
    The DAG is named `example-dag-basic` and has a start date of `2021-01-01`.
    The DAG is configured to run every day at midnight.
    The DAG is configured to use the `example_dag_basic` Airflow plugin.
    The DAG is configured with 2 retries.

## Tasks:
The DAG has 3 tasks defined:

    - `extract`: gets data from a hardcoded JSON string
    - `transform`: transforms the data
    - `load`: loads the data into a database
